# Weather App(React,Material UI,Leaflet Map API)

I built a weather app with react and Material UI. For getting weather information I used "Openweathermap Api". When you search for a city name that you want to learn about its weather condition, you can see the location marker at the same time and information pop-up attached to it. Also on first load of the page you can give location access permit and see the weather at your location. For this feature I used react-geolocated package.
